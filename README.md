# 🧠 Machine Learning Project

This is a simple Machine Learning project built using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The goal of this project is to explore basic ML workflows including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Description

The project demonstrates how to:

- Load and explore a dataset
- Clean and preprocess the data
- Train and evaluate different machine learning models
- Analyze performance with metrics and visualizations
- Make predictions on new or unseen data

This repository was created for learning purposes, to practice implementing ML models and organizing code in a reproducible way.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/peduz/machine_learning.git
   cd machine_learning
````

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start exploring or run your training scripts.

## 🧪 Example Models

Depending on the dataset used, the models may include:

* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Neural networks (basic)

## 📊 Results

Results and visualizations are available in the Jupyter notebooks. Plots include:

* Accuracy / loss curves
* Confusion matrix
* Feature importance
* Scatter and correlation plots
